When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I'd like to control when my local repository is updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork clones a repository on GitHub.
A clone clones a repository on the local machine or copy a repository from GitHub.
A branch creates a different path of development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Git can compare the local master version of the repository with the last
checked out one.
